    """
    Helper function to requeue a task for retry, using the new version of arguments provided.

    Inputs are the same as for running a task, plus two extra indicating the state at the time of retry.
    These include the `current_exception` that the task encountered that is causing the retry attempt,
    and the `subtask_status` that is to be returned.  A third extra argument `skip_retry_max`
    indicates whether the current retry should be subject to a maximum test.

    Returns a tuple of two values:
      * First value is a dict which represents current progress.  Keys are:

        'task_id' : id of subtask.  This is used to pass task information across retries.
        'attempted' : number of attempts -- should equal succeeded plus failed
        'succeeded' : number that succeeded in processing
        'skipped' : number that were not processed.
        'failed' : number that failed during processing
        'retried_nomax' : number of times the subtask has been retried for conditions that
            should not have a maximum count applied
        'retried_withmax' : number of times the subtask has been retried for conditions that
            should have a maximum count applied
        'state' : celery state of the subtask (e.g. QUEUING, PROGRESS, RETRY, FAILURE, SUCCESS)

      * Second value is an exception returned by the innards of the method.  If the retry was
        successfully submitted, this value will be the RetryTaskError that retry() returns.
        Otherwise, it (ought to be) the current_exception passed in.
