    Performs generic update by visiting StudentModule instances with the update_fcn provided.

    StudentModule instances are those that match the specified `course_id` and `module_state_key`.
    If `student_identifier` is not None, it is used as an additional filter to limit the modules to those belonging
    to that student. If `student_identifier` is None, performs update on modules for all students on the specified problem.

    If a `filter_fcn` is not None, it is applied to the query that has been constructed.  It takes one
    argument, which is the query being filtered, and returns the filtered version of the query.

    The `update_fcn` is called on each StudentModule that passes the resulting filtering.
    It is passed three arguments:  the module_descriptor for the module pointed to by the
    module_state_key, the particular StudentModule to update, and the xmodule_instance_args being
    passed through.  If the value returned by the update function evaluates to a boolean True,
    the update is successful; False indicates the update on the particular student module failed.
    A raised exception indicates a fatal condition -- that no other student modules should be considered.

    The return value is a dict containing the task's results, with the following keys:

          'attempted': number of attempts made
          'succeeded': number of attempts that "succeeded"
          'skipped': number of attempts that "skipped"
          'failed': number of attempts that "failed"
          'total': number of possible subtasks to attempt
          'action_name': user-visible verb to use in status messages.  Should be past-tense.
              Pass-through of input `action_name`.
          'duration_ms': how long the task has (or had) been running.

    Because this is run internal to a task, it does not catch exceptions.  These are allowed to pass up to the
    next level, so that it can set the failure modes and capture the error trace in the InstructorTask and the
    result object.

    The `entry_id` is the primary key for the InstructorTask entry representing the task.  This function
    updates the entry on success and failure of the perform_module_state_update function it
    wraps.  It is setting the entry's value for task_state based on what Celery would set it to once
    the task returns to Celery:  FAILURE if an exception is encountered, and SUCCESS if it returns normally.
    Other arguments are pass-throughs to perform_module_state_update, and documented there.

    If no exceptions are raised, a dict containing the task's result is returned, with the following keys:

    Before returning, this is also JSON-serialized and stored in the task_output column of the InstructorTask entry.

    If an exception is raised internally, it is caught and recorded in the InstructorTask entry.
