    as is the 'duration_ms' value.  A 'start_time' is stored for later duration calculations,
    and the total number of "things to do" is set, so the user can be told how much needs to be
    done overall.  The `action_name` is also stored, to help with constructing more readable

    running.  If not, there is a chance that the subtasks could complete before the parent task
    is done creating subtasks.  Doing so also simplifies the save() here, as it avoids the need
    for locking.

    rely on the status stored in the InstructorTask object, rather than status stored in the

    committed on completion, or rolled back on error.
